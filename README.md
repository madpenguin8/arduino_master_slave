Arduino Master/Slave is aimed at providing a simple means of controlling and monitoring remote Arduino slaves. 

Some of the goals of the project include:
Reading analog inputs on slaves to monitor various sensors.
Control digital outputs on slaves.
Monitor digital inputs on slaves.
Provide access to master functions via a web interface.
Provide notifications via email/sms of remote slave status i.e. if a input changes state or an analog value is 
exceeded then a notification is pushed.
